# Open Game Standards Alliance — Local Telemetry Standard, schema v1 (two-layer)
#
# Layers (see DESIGN.md):
#   DiscoveryFrame — low rate: once per session, re-sent on change. Self-describing
#                    metadata: environment, objects, drive points, channel descriptors.
#   MotionFrame    — high rate (~60 Hz): bare kinematics + state values, keyed by the
#                    ids declared in DiscoveryFrame.
#
# Principles:
#   - Static metadata lives in discovery; per-frame samples stay bare (no repeated
#     units/ranges/enums on the wire).
#   - Domain generality: drive points are a union (wheel/propeller/jet/sail/leg/generic);
#     channels are typed key-values declared up front — any game, any domain.
#   - Unknown-field skipping in both directions: receivers ignore unknown fields and
#     unknown union variants, so v1.x can add without breaking deployed decoders.
